# Grants-metrics
Calculation of core metrics related to grants activity

This repo contains all the code needed to calculate grants metrics related to grant activity. It has two main dependencies:
* This code is designed to run on one of the [SWAP](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/SWAP) servers and will not work elsewhere.
* The grants-related metrics are calculated from Fluxx data reports. In later quarters, this will also be the case for content-related metrics and participant-related metrics. 

For a full list of metric definitions, see the Grants Data Dictionary (WIP).

# Usage
1. Clone this onto one of the [SWAP](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/SWAP) hosts.
1. Run the notebook
